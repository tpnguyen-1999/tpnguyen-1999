## WELCOME TO MY PAGE ðŸ‘‹

My name is Thu Phuong Nguyen. Iâ€™m deeply passionate about **Data Analysis** and am actively looking for new opportunities to apply my skills in real-world projects. I am eager to work on data-driven problems, uncover insights, and help organizations make data-informed decisions.

If you have any opportunities, feel free to reach outâ€”Iâ€™d love to collaborate and contribute to meaningful projects!
